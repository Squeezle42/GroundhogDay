# Cross-Platform Development Strategy for Time Loop

This document outlines our strategy for developing Time Loop as a cross-platform game for Apple, Android, Windows, and Linux systems.

## Approach: Web First, Native Later

We're using a web-based foundation for our game, which provides several advantages for cross-platform development:

### Current Web-Based Stack

- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: Core technologies for our game interface
- **Canvas API**: For rendering game elements and animations
- **Local Storage**: For saving game progress in the browser
- **Service Workers**: For offline capabilities
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: For installable experience on mobile devices

### Benefits of Web-First Approach

1. **Single Codebase**: Write once, run everywhere
2. **Rapid Iteration**: Fast development cycles with instant feedback
3. **Low Entry Barrier**: Works immediately in any modern browser
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add features as needed
5. **Broader Accessibility**: Runs on any device with a browser

## Native Packaging Strategy

After developing the core game with web technologies, we'll package it for native platforms:

### 1. Desktop Applications (Windows/macOS/Linux)

- **Electron**: Package the web app as a desktop application
- **Benefits**:
  - Access to file system for better save management
  - Better performance for desktop systems
  - Standalone application with icon and system integration
  - Access to native APIs when needed

### 2. Mobile Applications (iOS/Android)

- **Capacitor/Cordova**: Convert the web app to native mobile apps
- **Benefits**:
  - Distribution through App Store and Google Play
  - Access to native device features (sensors, cameras, etc.)
  - Better performance on mobile devices
  - Push notifications and other mobile-specific features

## Development Workflow

1. **Core Development** (Current Phase): 
   - Develop the game using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
   - Test in browsers across platforms using BrowserSync
   - Implement core gameplay mechanics

2. **Optimization Phase**:
   - Add responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Optimize images and assets for different platforms
   - Implement touch controls for mobile devices

3. **Platform-Specific Packaging**:
   - Package for desktop using Electron
   - Package for mobile using Capacitor
   - Add platform-specific features as needed

## Testing Strategy

- **Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Device Testing**: Various screen sizes and resolutions
- **Platform Testing**: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android

## Tools & Scripts

- **dev_server.bat/sh**: Start a development server with live reload
- **launch_windows.bat**: Launch the game in Chrome app mode on Windows
- **launch_macos.sh**: Launch the game in Chrome app mode on macOS
- **launch_linux.sh**: Launch the game in Chrome/Firefox on Linux

## Progressive Web App (PWA) Setup

We've implemented PWA capabilities to make the web version installable:

- **manifest.json**: App metadata and icon information
- **service-worker.js**: Offline caching and background synchronization
- **Icons**: Various sized icons for different platforms

## Future Considerations

1. **Game Engine Migration**:
   - Consider migrating to a WebGL framework like Phaser or Three.js for more complex game features
   - Evaluate Unity WebGL export for advanced 3D capabilities

2. **Native API Integration**:
   - Cloud save across devices
   - Achievements and leaderboards
   - Platform-specific features

3. **Distribution Channels**:
   - Steam (Windows/macOS/Linux)
   - Epic Games Store
   - App Store (iOS/iPadOS)
   - Google Play Store (Android)
   - Microsoft Store (Windows)
