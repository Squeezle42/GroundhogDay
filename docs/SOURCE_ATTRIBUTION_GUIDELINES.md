# Source Attribution Guidelines

## Importance of Crediting Sources

### Why We Credit All Sources
- **Legal Compliance**: Proper attribution helps ensure compliance with copyright and intellectual property laws
- **Ethical Practice**: Acknowledging others' work demonstrates professional integrity and respect
- **Community Building**: Credits recognize the collaborative nature of creative and technical work
- **Documentation Quality**: Well-attributed projects are more professionally documented and easier for others to understand
- **Due Recognition**: Creators and contributors deserve acknowledgment for their work that benefits our projects

## Attribution Best Practices

1. **Document All Sources Early**
   - Begin tracking sources from the start of a project
   - Don't wait until completion to identify what needs attribution
   - Use the SOURCE_ATTRIBUTION_TEMPLATE.md as a living document throughout development

2. **Be Comprehensive**
   - Credit ALL sources, no matter how small their contribution seems
   - Include tools, libraries, and resources used during development
   - Document placeholder assets and plan for proper replacement

3. **Be Specific**
   - Include specifics about how each source was used
   - Identify exactly which parts of your project incorporate others' work
   - Note license terms and compliance methods

4. **Maintain Attribution**
   - Update credits when new sources are added
   - Remove credits for sources no longer used
   - Review attributions before each release

## Required Attribution Documents

Every project should include:

1. **CREDITS.md** - Comprehensive list of all sources using our standard template
2. **README.md section** - Brief credits for major sources with link to detailed CREDITS.md
3. **In-app credits** - For user-facing applications, include accessible credits within the application

## Placeholder Content

When using placeholder content during development:
1. Document its source
2. Clearly mark it as temporary
3. Note the plan and timeline for replacement
4. Ensure final product only contains properly licensed or original content

## License Compliance

Different sources have different requirements for attribution:
- Some require visible credit in the application
- Some only require credit in documentation
- Some have specific formatting requirements for attribution

Always review and comply with the specific license terms for each source used.

*Remember: Good attribution is a mark of professionalism and respect for the broader creative and development community. It's not just about legal complianceâ€”it's about being a good citizen in the ecosystem of creators upon whose work we build.*
