*Note: When using this template, include ALL sources that contributed to your project, even if they seem minor. If a source doesn't fit neatly into the categories above, create a new appropriate section. Always verify license terms and ensure your usage complies with them.*

*For any placeholder or temporary assets used during development, clearly mark them as such and document your plan for replacing them with properly licensed or original assets before release.*
