# Time Loop - Development Strategy

## Phased Implementation Plan

Our Time Loop game will be developed and released in a phased approach, focusing first on the core experience elements that define the beginning and conclusion of the narrative. This strategy allows us to:

1. Get early feedback on the narrative framing
2. Establish the technical foundation
3. Test core mechanics in a controlled environment
4. Create anticipation for the full gameplay experience

## Current Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: Narrative Bookends

We are currently implementing:

- **Opening Sequence**: Player wakes up, discovers they're in a time loop
- **UI Framework**: All user interface elements needed for full gameplay
- **End Game Sequence**: Credits and narrative conclusion 

This creates a complete gameplay loop that can be experienced from start to finish, providing the full emotional arc of the story.

```

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Town Structure
- Town map implementation
- Basic NPC placement
- Building interiors
- Time-based events foundation

### Phase 3: Core Mechanics
- Complete time loop mechanics
- Character memory systems
- NPC schedules and routines
- Item persistence mechanics

### Phase 4: Narrative Expansion
- Full story implementation
- Main quest line
- Character arcs
- Multi-day puzzle sequences

## Current Implementation Focus

For our immediate development, we are focusing on creating a compelling introduction that hooks players into the time loop concept and a satisfying conclusion that acknowledges our inspirations.

This allows us to validate our core game concept with minimal development resources while building anticipation for the complete experience.

## Testing Strategy

1. Initial testing with narrative bookends only
2. Feature testing as core components are added
3. Gradual expansion of the game world
4. Full end-to-end testing with complete narrative

## Release Strategy

- **Tech Demo**: Initial release with narrative framework
- **Early Access**: Core gameplay with partial town implementation
- **Full Release**: Complete narrative and gameplay experience

This phased approach ensures we can deliver a quality product while managing development resources effectively.
