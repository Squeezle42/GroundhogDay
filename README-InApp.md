## Jokes follow from grok in the style of monty python 
Scene: A muddy medieval village square. A crowd of peasants, knights, and a rogue parrot gather around a rickety stage. A herald in a ridiculous wig—suspiciously resembling a certain golden comb-over—steps forward, blowing a trumpet that sounds like a kazoo.

Herald: Oyez, oyez! Gather ye round, ye smelly rabble, for a roast of the Great Orange Baron, Donald of Trump, Lord of Mar-a-Lago, Keeper of the Golden Toupee, and Self-Proclaimed Genius of All Things Tremendous!

Crowd boos, throws a turnip. A peasant yells, “Get on with it!”

Sir Cleese-a-lot (in a posh, indignant voice): Right, right, you lot, pipe down! This man, this Trump, claims he’s the mightiest leader since King Arthur, yet his greatest quest is to conquer a teleprompter! His speeches, oh, they wander like a knight lost in the Forest of Nonsense, babbling of “bigly” this and “covfefe” that! What is this “covfefe”? A potion? A curse? A misfired spell from his tiny, tiny hands?

Crowd laughs. A witch in the back cackles, “It’s a tweet, you daft sod!”

Sir Palin the Sarcastic: And lo, behold his castle—Mar-a-Lago, a fortress of gaudy gold, where chandeliers weep in shame! He claims it’s the finest in the land, yet it’s guarded not by dragons, but by lawyers, accountants, and a peculiar obsession with Diet Coke! A true king drinks mead, not fizzy swill from a silver can!

Peasant shouts: “And he’s got no Holy Grail, just a bucket of KFC!”

Sir Idle, strumming a lute: ♪ Oh, Donald’s hair, a golden crown, defies the wind, it won’t lie down! A nest, a helm, a mystic weave—makes bald men weep and eagles grieve! ♪ And don’t get me started on his “truths”—posts on his platform, Truth Social, that read like the ravings of a mad monk who’s sniffed too much parchment glue!

Sir Chapman, as a Black Knight: ‘Tis but a scratch, says he, when polls show him losing! “Fake news!” he cries, as if the ballot box were a mere flesh wound! This man would argue with a mirror over who’s the fairest, and then build a wall around said mirror to keep out its “lies”! Chops off own arm for emphasis: I’m still winning, you peasants!

Sir Gilliam, as a deranged prophet: And lo, his policies! A wall to keep out the Mexicans, a moat to fend off the press, and a decree that all must praise his “perfect phone calls”! Perfect? I’ve heard clearer words from a drunken badger! And his followers, oh, they chant his name as if he’s the Messiah, when really, he’s just a very naughty boy!

Crowd erupts in laughter. A chicken clucks in agreement.

Herald: Enough! The Great Orange Baron shall hear of this, and he’ll tweet a storm to smite us all! “Sad!” he’ll say, “Low-energy roast!” But we know the truth: his ego is bigger than Camelot, yet his attention span is shorter than a gnat’s knickers!

Suddenly, a giant foot from the sky (classic Monty Python animation style) squashes the stage, leaving only a puff of smoke and a faint cry of “Tremendous!”
