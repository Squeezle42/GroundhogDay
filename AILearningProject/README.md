## Getting Started

1. Review the main LearningAI.md document for theoretical foundation
2. Explore the templates directory for reusable prompt structures
3. Complete the exercises that match your current month in the course
4. Use the tools directory to enhance your AI collaboration workflow

## Key Features

- **Prompt Templates**: Ready-to-use templates that follow best practices
- **Progressive Exercises**: Hands-on activities that align with the 6-month course
- **Collaboration Tools**: Scripts to help manage AI context and coordinate multiple threads
- **Practical Examples**: Demonstration projects showing AI collaboration in action

## Usage with Groundhog Day Game

This learning project can be directly applied to your Groundhog Day game development:

1. Use the debugging templates when encountering issues in your game code
2. Apply the thread coordination tools when working on multiple aspects of your game simultaneously
3. Follow the exercises to implement new features in your game
4. Analyze your prompting effectiveness when developing complex game systems

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own templates, exercises, and tools as you discover effective patterns.
