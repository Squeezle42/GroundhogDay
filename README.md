# Time Loop: A Groundhog Day-Inspired Game

## Project Overview
Time Loop is a narrative adventure game where players experience life in a small town caught in a temporal loop. As a cynical big-city professional trapped in an endlessly repeating day, players must forge relationships with townsfolk and solve interconnected puzzles to break free from the loop.

## Key Features
- **Temporal Paradox**: Experience the same day repeatedly with knowledge retention between loops
- **Character-Driven Narrative**: Develop relationships with unique townspeople who have their own schedules and stories
- **Puzzle Progression**: Use information gathered in previous loops to unlock new pathways and solutions
- **Evolving Dialogue**: Conversations change based on player knowledge and relationship development
- **Small Town Setting**: Explore a charming winter wonderland with secrets to discover
