### Code Practices & Architecture

#### Modularity & Component Design
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Divided the application into distinct modules with specific responsibilities.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Built reusable UI components with well-defined interfaces.
*   **State Management:** Implemented Redux as the centralized state management solution.
*   **Event-Driven Design:** Using events/callbacks for communication between loosely coupled components.

#### Class Structure & Object-Oriented Design
*   **Domain Models:**
    *   `Note`: Core entity with properties like title, content, tags, etc.
    *   `Category`: For organizing notes hierarchically.
    *   `Tag`: For flexible note classification.
    *   `User`: For authentication and personalization.
*   **Service Classes:**
    *   `NoteService`: CRUD operations for notes.
    *   `SyncService`: Handling cross-device synchronization.
    *   `SearchService`: Advanced search functionality.
    *   `FileService`: Managing file attachments.
*   **Interface Definitions:** Define clear interfaces for all major components.

#### Directory Structure
```
/src
  /api               # API interfaces and utilities
  /assets            # Static assets like images
  /components        # UI components organized by feature
    /categories      # Category-related components
    /common          # Shared UI components (Button, Modal, etc.)
    /editor          # Note editor components
    /notes           # Note listing and viewing components
    /tags            # Tag-related components
  /hooks             # Custom React hooks
  /models            # TypeScript interfaces and types

#### Helper Scripts

*   **Development Server Scripts:**
    ```bash
    # package.json script examples
    "scripts": {
      "start": "react-scripts start",
      "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development react-scripts start",
      "dev:debug": "cross-env REACT_APP_DEBUG=true npm run dev",
      "build": "react-scripts build",
      "test": "react-scripts test --coverage",
      "eject": "react-scripts eject",
      "lint": "eslint --ext .ts,.tsx src/",
      "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx,json,md}\"",
      "storybook": "start-storybook -p 6006",
      "build-storybook": "build-storybook"
    }
    ```

*   **CLI Helper Tools:**
    * Create custom scripts in a `scripts` directory for:
        ```
        scripts/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup-dev.js       # Setup development environment
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kill-ports.js      # Kill processes on specific ports
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gen-component.js   # Generate component boilerplate
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gen-service.js     # Generate service boilerplate
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyze-bundle.js  # Analyze bundle size
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ launch-browser.js  # Open browser with correct URLs
        ```

#### CORS Prevention & API Proxying

*   **Development Proxy Configuration:**
    ```javascript
    // setupProxy.js
    const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');
    
    module.exports = function(app) {
      app.use(
        '/api',
        createProxyMiddleware({
          target: 'http://localhost:8080',
          changeOrigin: true,
          pathRewrite: {
            '^/api': '',
          },
        })
      );
    };
    ```

*   **CORS Headers for Development Server:**
    ```javascript
    // Example Express middleware for dev server
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
      res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS');
      res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
      next();
    });
    ```

#### Testing Best Practices

*   **Avoid Unnecessary Mocking:**
    * Use real implementations of libraries like Three.js in tests where possible
    * Only mock external APIs or heavy dependencies that would slow tests
    * Create reusable test fixtures for common data structures
    
*   **Test Utilities:**
    ```typescript
    // test-utils.ts
    import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
    import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
    import { theme } from '../src/styles/theme';
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
    import { store } from '../src/store';
    
    const AllProviders = ({ children }) => {
      return (
        <Provider store={store}>
          <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>
        </Provider>
      );
    };
    
    const customRender = (ui, options) => 
      render(ui, { wrapper: AllProviders, ...options });
      
    export * from '@testing-library/react';
    export { customRender as render };
    ```

#### Live Preview & Hot Reloading

*   **Browser Sync Integration:**
    ```bash
    # Install Browser Sync
    npm install browser-sync --save-dev
    
    # Add to package.json
    "scripts": {
      "live": "browser-sync start --proxy 'localhost:3000' --files 'build/**/*' --no-notify"
    }
    ```

*   **VSCode Live Preview Configuration:**
    * Install "Live Server" or "Live Preview" extension
    * Configure in settings.json:
    ```json
    {
      "liveServer.settings.port": 5501,
      "liveServer.settings.root": "/build",
      "liveServer.settings.CustomBrowser": "chrome",
      "liveServer.settings.AdvanceCustomBrowserCmdLine": "chrome --incognito --remote-debugging-port=9222"
    }
    ```

#### Monitoring & Debugging
