# Time Loop Game Project: Development Collaboration

## Project Overview

This document captures the collaboration between the project owner and GitHub Copilot to develop the "Time Loop" game project - a Groundhog Day-inspired adventure game where players navigate a time loop in a small town.

## Initial Documentation Phase (April 2025)

Based on the initial concept outlined in GroundhogDayGameDev.md, we developed a comprehensive set of project documentation:

1. **README.md**: Project overview with key features and high-level information
2. **ROADMAP.md**: Detailed development timeline with phases and milestones
3. **GROUNDHOGDAY.md**: Extensive game design document covering mechanics, setting, characters, and systems
4. **COPILOT.md**: Guide document for AI assistance during development
5. **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**: Proposed directory structure for the game implementation

## Current Development Status

As of April 28, 2025, the project is in the early planning phase (Phase 1 of the roadmap), focusing on:
- Game design document finalization
- Technology stack selection
- Project structure setup

## Collaboration Notes

The collaboration process demonstrates how AI assistance can help:
- Structure and organize game development documentation
- Create comprehensive design documents from concept outlines
- Plan project architecture and directory structures
- Maintain consistent terminology and project vision across documents
- Develop a realistic roadmap with timelines and milestones
