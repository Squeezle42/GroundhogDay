# Time Loop: Copilot Assistance Guide

## Current Development Focus
We are now beginning the initial implementation phase of our Time Loop game. With the documentation structure in place, we're transitioning to setting up the basic project structure, implementing the core HTML/JS prototype, and designing the storyline that will guide our game development.

## Active Tasks
- Creating the basic web-based prototype with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- Implementing the foundational game mechanics
- Developing the original storyline for the game
- Setting up the image asset structure and requirements
- Creating documentation for art direction and asset needs

## Next Steps for Copilot Assistance

### Immediate (Current Session)
- Implement core JavaScript files for the time loop game prototype
- Create the initial storyline and narrative flow
- Design the game state management system
- Document required image assets with specifications

### Short-term
- Develop the character interaction system
- Implement time progression mechanics
- Create the day/night cycle visual effects
- Build the dialogue system prototype
- Design the quest tracking mechanism

### Medium-term
- Assist with code implementation for day/night cycle
- Help troubleshoot time loop persistence issues
- Generate code for quest tracking across time loops
- Develop solutions for dialogue evolution based on player knowledge

## Project Constraints
- Focus on original content without direct references to copyrighted material
- Prioritize maintainable code architecture for complex time loop mechanics
- Consider performance implications of NPC scheduling systems
- Apply GNU GPL v3.0 license header to all source code files
- Ensure compliance with copyleft licensing requirements for code contributions and dependencies

## Notes for Copilot
- Please suggest modular approaches to game systems where possible
- Provide examples and references when suggesting technical solutions
- When suggesting code, focus on readability and maintainability
- Consider both prototyping (quick implementation) and production-quality solutions
