# Time Loop Game Development - Copilot Assistance

## Current Progress

We've set up the foundational Unreal Engine systems for the Time Loop game based on the project roadmap. The initial implementation focuses on creating the core C++ classes that will power our game mechanics, particularly the time loop functionality.

## Core Systems Implemented

1. **TimeLoopGameMode**
   - Central coordinator for all game systems
   - Handles initialization, saving, loading, and time loop resets
   - Manages references to all subsystems

2. **Time System**
   - `TimeManager`: Handles game time progression, day/night cycles, and loop transitions
   - `TimeLoopSaveGame`: Manages persistent data across time loops

3. **Character System**
   - `NPCScheduler`: Controls NPC schedules, daily routines, and relationship values
   - `NPCCharacter`: Base character class for all NPCs with interaction capabilities

4. **Quest System**
   - `QuestManager`: Tracks quest state, objectives, and player knowledge
   - Handles persistent vs. non-persistent quest progress across loops

5. **Dialogue System**
   - `DialogueManager`: Manages NPC conversations and dialogue trees
   - Support for conditional dialogue based on player knowledge

## Next Steps

### 1. Create the Player Character

- Implement `ATimeLoopPlayerCharacter` extending from `ACharacter`
- Add interaction system for detecting and interacting with NPCs and objects
- Implement player inventory system
- Set up camera controls and player input

### 2. Develop the Environment and World State System

- Create `ULocationManager` to track environment states and transitions
- Implement a weather system with visual weather state changes
- Set up environment interaction objects
- Build the clock tower mechanism puzzle

### 3. Build the UI Framework

- Design and implement HUD elements for:
  - Time display
  - Quest tracking
  - Dialogue interface
  - Inventory
  - Journal system to track discovered knowledge
  - Relationships panel

### 4. Create the Initial Test Level

- Design a small test environment with:
  - Player spawn point
  - Clock tower
  - A few test buildings
  - Test NPCs with schedules
  - Interactive objects
  - Weather variation

### 5. Implement Data-Driven Content

- Create data tables for:
  - NPCs and their schedules
  - Dialogue trees
  - Quests and objectives
  - Knowledge flags

### 6. Testing Framework

- Implement test mode to accelerate time for debugging
- Create tools to inspect NPC states, schedules, and relationships
- Add debug visualization for time-sensitive elements

## Blueprint Integration Plan

While we've set up the core C++ classes, many of these systems will be exposed to Blueprints to allow for easier content creation:

1. Create Blueprint subclasses for `NPCCharacter` for each story character
2. Implement Blueprint interfaces for interactive objects
3. Create Blueprint data assets for dialogue trees and quest definitions
4. Expose key events through Blueprint-implementable events

## Technical Decisions

- Using C++ for core systems to ensure performance and stability
- Leveraging Unreal's save game system for persistent data
- Implementing a modular design where systems can be tested independently
- Using game subsystem approach rather than singletons for better testability

## Getting Started on Development

To begin work on the next phase:

1. Complete the basic project setup in Unreal Engine
2. Create a new C++ project with the structure defined in these files
3. Import the core system files we've created
4. Set up source control to track changes
5. Begin implementing the player character and test environment

## Key Technical Challenges to Address

1. Maintaining time synchronization across all systems
2. Efficiently saving and restoring world state during loop resets
3. Managing relationships between persistent and non-persistent data
4. Implementing efficient scheduling for potentially many NPCs
5. Creating a system for environment state changes based on player actions

## Timeline Estimate

- **System Implementation:** 4-6 weeks
- **Basic Environment/Testing:** 2-3 weeks
- **Content Creation Tools:** 2 weeks
- **Initial Gameplay Loop Testing:** 2 weeks

This foundation will enable us to start building the actual gameplay mechanics and begin implementing the story content defined in our design documents.
