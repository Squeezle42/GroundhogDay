# Time Loop: Copilot Assistance Guide

## Current Development Focus
We are in the early planning and documentation phase of our Groundhog Day-inspired time loop adventure game. The project is currently focused on conceptualization, documentation, and planning the initial technical architecture.

## Active Tasks
- Developing the project documentation structure
- Planning the technology stack and game architecture
- Designing core gameplay systems focusing on the time loop mechanic

## Next Steps for Copilot Assistance

### Immediate (Current Session)
- Suggest a directory structure for the game project
- Provide insights on implementing time loop mechanics in various game engines
- Help with technical planning for NPC scheduling and memory systems

### Short-term
- Create boilerplate code for core game mechanics prototypes
- Suggest implementation approaches for knowledge retention between time loops
- Develop pseudocode for character scheduling systems
- Provide templates for dialogue tree structures

### Medium-term
- Assist with code implementation for day/night cycle
- Help troubleshoot time loop persistence issues
- Generate code for quest tracking across time loops
- Develop solutions for dialogue evolution based on player knowledge

## Project Constraints
- Focus on original content without direct references to copyrighted material
- Prioritize maintainable code architecture for complex time loop mechanics
- Consider performance implications of NPC scheduling systems
- Apply GNU GPL v3.0 license header to all source code files
- Ensure compliance with copyleft licensing requirements for code contributions and dependencies

## Notes for Copilot
- Please suggest modular approaches to game systems where possible
- Provide examples and references when suggesting technical solutions
- When suggesting code, focus on readability and maintainability
- Consider both prototyping (quick implementation) and production-quality solutions
