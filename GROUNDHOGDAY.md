# Time Loop: Detailed Game Design

## Game Concept
"Time Loop" is a narrative-driven adventure game that puts players in the shoes of a character trapped in an endlessly repeating day in a small winter town. This document explores the detailed design elements that will bring this concept to life.

## Development Status
**Current Implementation:** The game currently includes a complete introduction sequence and ending credits. Players can press the [End] key at any time to skip to the ending sequence. The middle portions of gameplay will be implemented in future updates.

**Special Credits:** The game features special thanks to Bill Murray for his iconic performance in "Groundhog Day," and includes Chris Hadfield's rendition of "Rocket Man" during the end credits.

## Time Loop Mechanics

### Loop Structure
- Each loop begins at 6:00 AM when the protagonist wakes up
- The day ends at midnight or if the protagonist falls asleep/gets knocked out
- The town and its inhabitants reset to their original state at the beginning of each loop
- The protagonist retains all knowledge and certain key items across loops

### Loop Progression
- Early loops: Player is disoriented and learning basic town layout and character routines
- Mid-game loops: Player starts manipulating events with foreknowledge
- Late-game loops: Complex puzzle solving using knowledge from multiple previous loops
- Final loops: Executing a perfect sequence of events to break free

## Setting: Groundhog Hollow

### Town Layout
- **Town Square**: Central hub with the iconic clock tower and groundhog statue
- **Main Street**: Shops, restaurants, and services
- **Residential Area**: Homes of various townsfolk
- **Municipal Buildings**: Town hall, police station, library
- **Outskirts**: Forest paths, abandoned mine, frozen lake
- **Secret Areas**: Locations that only unlock through specific actions

### Time Periods
- **Morning** (6:00 AM - 11:59 AM): Town waking up, businesses opening
- **Afternoon** (12:00 PM - 5:59 PM): Peak activity in town
- **Evening** (6:00 PM - 11:59 PM): Businesses closing, social gatherings
- **Special Events**: Scheduled town events that occur at specific times

## Character System

### Protagonist Development
- Starts as cynical and self-centered
- Can develop skills and relationships across loops
- Character growth reflected in dialogue options and actions
- Internal monologue evolves to reflect growing understanding of the loop

### NPC System
- Each NPC has:
  - Daily schedule and routine
  - Relationship meter with protagonist
  - Unique personality and problems
  - Knowledge state (what they know about the protagonist and events)
- NPC interactions change based on:
  - Time of day
  - Previous interactions within the current loop
  - Protagonist's knowledge from previous loops
  - Items or information the protagonist possesses

### Key Townspeople
- **Mayor**: Organizing the annual Groundhog Festival
- **Diner Owner**: Knows everyone's gossip and food preferences
- **Clockmaker**: Obsessed with time, potential ally in understanding the loop
- **Sheriff**: Suspicious of the protagonist's strange behavior
- **Librarian**: Holds knowledge about town history and legends
- **Festival Groundhog Handler**: Stressed about the upcoming ceremony
- **Various Townsfolk**: Each with unique stories and schedules

## Gameplay Systems

### Knowledge System
- **Journal**: Automatically updates with discoveries and character information
- **Conversation Topics**: Unlock new dialogue options based on learned information
- **Skills**: Learn abilities that carry over between loops (lockpicking, cooking, etc.)
- **Maps**: Track discovered locations and points of interest

### Puzzle Types
- **Time-Based Puzzles**: Being in the right place at the right time
- **Multi-Loop Puzzles**: Gathering information across several loops to solve a problem
- **Character Puzzles**: Understanding personalities to predict behavior
- **Environmental Puzzles**: Manipulating the physical environment
- **Butterfly Effect Puzzles**: Changing one early event to affect later outcomes

### Quest Structure
- **Main Quest**: Breaking free from the time loop
- **Character Quests**: Helping townspeople with their problems
- **Discovery Quests**: Uncovering town secrets and hidden areas
- **Mastery Quests**: Performing perfect sequences of actions

## Artistic Direction

### Visual Style
- Colorful, slightly stylized visuals with emphasis on character expressiveness
- Strong visual indicators for time of day and weather conditions
- Environmental storytelling through detailed backgrounds
- Subtle visual cues for important objects and interactions

### Audio Design
- Theme music that evolves slightly with each loop
- Environmental audio that helps track time of day
- Character-specific musical motifs
- Sound design that emphasizes repetition and variation

## Technical Considerations

### Save System
- Auto-saves at the beginning of each loop
- Manual saves during loops for experimentation
- Loop counter tracking total attempts

### Accessibility Features
- Configurable time pressure elements
- Visual and audio cues for important events
- Comprehensive journal system for tracking information
- Optional hints system

## Narrative Themes
- The value of community and relationships
- Personal growth and overcoming cynicism
- The beauty found in everyday moments
- The importance of helping others
- Finding meaning in seemingly meaningless repetition
